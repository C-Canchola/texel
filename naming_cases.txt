Potential Name and Refers To - P_nm, P_rf
All Name and Refers To - A_nm, A_rf
Trackaed Name and Refers To - T_nm, T_rf

CASE 1:
    P_nm_i and P_rf_i not in A_nm, A_rf
    Potential name and refers to el does not exist at all in all of the workbook names.
    SOLUTION:
        Add to workbook normally by address.
    
CASE 2:
    No Action
    Potential name and ref has a single match in tracked.
    Name is already named correctly.

CASE 3:
    Single Rename
    Potential name not in tracked name.
    Potential ref IS in tracked ref
    Tracked name not in potential name.

    Probably most important to handle correctly as a rename will update and dependent formulas
    while a delete and addition will not.

    Rename tracked name to potential name.

CASE 4:
    Swap

    Potential name in tracked name.
    Potential ref is not equal to tracked name ref

    This means there exists another tracked name with the correct ref
    and name mismatch.

    Delete other name, name that one correctly (using potential names)

CASE 5:
    
    Potential name exists twice.

    ERROR?
    Or take first?

    Very heavily leaning towards the side of error.
    Taking first will certainly lead to ambiguity and mistakes in the future.
