Work on a name manager that can add/remove/update named ranges.


Idea for pipeline of changes.

VALIDATION/RULE SET - This is where I will apply naming conventions, validation, etc to any changes to
either worksheets or the named ranges.

SHEET_TRACKER - This will handle any changes to the worksheets.

NAME_MANAGER - This will have to respond to changes made by the SHEET_TRACKER as well as handle the ability to change at a lower level.





TO ADD:
When adding a sheet, include the formula =SHEET(first_cell of sheet) in order to keep strack if the
sheet exists and whether or not their names match what is given.
    -- Essentially a way to keep a pointer/reference to a sheet by using Excel itself.


Formula formatting

Coloring

Index tracking.

Archive functionality (just quick saving essentially, will be easy)

Logging - Track changes such as index setting, named range changes (add, rename, swaps, deletions)

Name rules - How to handle column headings that do not adhere to the rules needed to add a range as name.
    - How much flexibility should be allowed when building workbooks with texel?
    -- Should names be FORCED to abide by naming conventions?
    -- Should conversion on the backend happen for every case?
    -- Should it be a mix? e.g. Force naming convention of CAPITAL_SHEET_NAME__variable_name but conversion for things such as special characters?
