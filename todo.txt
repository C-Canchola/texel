Work on a name manager that can add/remove/update named ranges.


Idea for pipeline of changes.

VALIDATION/RULE SET - This is where I will apply naming conventions, validation, etc to any changes to
either worksheets or the named ranges.

SHEET_TRACKER - This will handle any changes to the worksheets.

NAME_MANAGER - This will have to respond to changes made by the SHEET_TRACKER as well as handle the ability to change at a lower level.
