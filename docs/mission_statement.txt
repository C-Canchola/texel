The mission of texel is to provide a framework for the 
design and creation of easily traceable Excel spreadsheets.

The inspiration comes from the design philosphies of Bob Martin and the
Zen of Python.

Essential Readings:
    - Clean Code by Bob Martin
    - Clean Architecture by Bob Martin
    - The Zen of Python

Core princicples of texel borrowed from the essential readings.
    
    From the Zen of Python:
    - Beautiful is better than ugly.
    - Explicit is better than implicit
    - Simple is better than complex
    - READABILITY COUNTS
    - The should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    - Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

    From Clean Code:
    - Be consistent. If you do something a certain way, do all similar things in the same way.
    - Follow standard conventions.
    - Keep it simple stupid. Simpler is always better. Reduce complexity as much as possible.
    - Boy scout rule. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
    - Use explanatory variables.
    - Choose descriptive and unambiguous names.
    - Use searchable names.
    - Replace magic numbers with named constants.
    - Functions should be:
        -- Small
        -- Do one thing
        -- Use descriptive names
        -- Prefer fewer arguments
    

In summation, the goal is to develop a framework that abides by these principles when
designing reusable spreadsheets that will most likely be passed of to a future team member.
