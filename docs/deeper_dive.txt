FOREWARD:
As of now 04/25/2020, the scope of texel is narrowly limited to the "backend"
of the inner workings of an Excel Spreadsheet/Model. I am not a front end designer
and would take anything I would say with a grain of salt when it comes to the presentation
of a spreadsheet. Visual taste is very subjective.

Far too often I will receive a spreadsheet either from a coworker or external
member and spend far too long chasing down references which may be on other tabs
or very distant positions on the same worksheet.

Rather than focusing on concepts, most time is devoted to understanding how
an individual is designing their spreadsheet.

Spreadsheets by their very nature a prone to this sort of pitfall due to their spatial
nature. Unlike the code found in a modern OOP programming laguage (Java, C#, Python) which
can be read more like a traditional set of instructions and relationships, "code" in excel
often becomes densely nested with hard to read conditionals, rigid due to position based
formulas (vlookups should never be used for this reason), and time consuming with the constant
movement required to fully understand the variables being referenced.
